# OCR-application
Android application to extract text in images into a text file.

This application uses Ocr space api for image to text conversions.

This application was build for android 5.0 and above.
In order to run the application, use supported version of android studio.

First of all copy all the java files into app>java folder.
Next copy all the layout xml files into res>layout folder, followed by string xml files into res>string and 2 png images into drawable folder.
At last, copy the android manifest xml file in app>manifests folder.

*N.B:-

*Better get your own free api key from ocr space api and use it .

*The result displayed depends upon the ocr-space server functioning and availablity.

*Suggestions are always welcomed. Thank You.
